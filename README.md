# guardian-scrabble-challenge
An attempt at the coding challenge from https://github.com/guardian/coding-exercises/tree/main/scrabble

The challenge is based on the popular board game "Scrabble" and starts of by introducing the rules to the game. Simply put you have a number of 'letter' tiles and each 'letter' scores a certain amount of points.

When playing the game you choose 7 random letters and then try to make a word that will score you as many points in total as possible.

The tasks requires you to write a function that will select random letters and work out the biggest dictionary word you can find from it along with some other really neat requirements to test your approach to the solution.

#### This is a SIMPLE attempt using symfony flex and phpunit to build up the required features using a TDD approach.
